# Wanderlust Responsibly
Project One Collaboration

## Purpose and Inspiration
The purpose of this is create a way to be a little bit responsible while travelling. There is a Firebase based to-do list or packing list to help keep track of what needs to be done before a trip.  When a destination is chosen in the search bar, the two API's that we have utilized will display the weather and a map of that location.


##API's and Libraries Used
We were challenged to use a new library or something that we have never used before. I (Grace) was in charge of the HTML and CSS, and since I was already familiar with Bootstrap and have used the newest Bootstrap 4 in other projects, I challenged myself and utilized Materialize for the first time. 

Google Maps API was used for autocomplete in the search bar as well as displaying the map of the location. A weather API used the information from the search bar to determine lattitude and longitude to display the current weather conditions.
